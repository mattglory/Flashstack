/**
 * What `clarinet deployments apply --mainnet` would publish from this repo.
 *
 * On any machine with a `settings/Mainnet.toml`, `apply --mainnet` publishes the
 * plan clarinet computes from Clarinet.toml: after two Enters by default, or with
 * no prompt at all under `-d`. Verified 2026-09-27 against clarinet 3.23.2 in a
 * network-isolated container with a throwaway key and a mock node (see the #75
 * review). Clarinet.toml registers the funds-bearing contracts under their real
 * names but pointed at their `contracts/test/` localized copies, so that plan
 * publishes those copies, whose sBTC calls resolve to the in-plan mock
 * `contracts/sbtc-token.clar`, plus test fixtures such as `malicious-token`.
 *
 * The target is that no `contracts/test/` path is in the mainnet plan. That needs
 * D6's structural fix (docs/security/CONTRACT_INVENTORY.md §7.3), so it cannot
 * pass yet and is recorded below with `it.fails`. Until then, the known set is
 * pinned so it cannot silently grow: registering one more `contracts/test/` file
 * in Clarinet.toml puts it in what a mainnet deploy run publishes, and must fail
 * here. When D6 lands, both tests will fail: empty KNOWN_TEST_PATHS and turn the
 * `it.fails` into `it`.
 *
 * Nothing is signed or sent. `deployments generate` only writes a plan file, in a
 * temp copy of the project. The dummy Mainnet.toml uses the public Clarinet
 * devnet deployer mnemonic already committed in settings/Devnet.toml, points at
 * an RPC address nothing listens on, and `--manual-cost` skips fee estimation.
 * Requirements resolve from the vendored `.cache`, so no network is needed
 * (verified in a `--network none` container).
 *
 * Needs the same clarinet version as CI (read from .github/workflows/test.yml).
 * Required in CI; skipped locally if missing or mismatched. Set CLARINET_BIN to
 * point at a matching binary.
