**Deployer:** `SP20XD46NGAX05ZQZDKFYCCX49A3852BQABNP0VG5`  
**Last updated:** May 2026

All amounts are in microSTX (1 STX = 1,000,000 microSTX) or satoshis (1 sBTC = 100,000,000 satoshis) unless otherwise noted.

### flash-loan

The primary entry point. Borrows STX on behalf of the caller, invokes the receiver callback, and verifies repayment — all in one atomic transaction.

```clarity
(define-public (flash-loan
  (amount uint)
  (receiver <stx-flash-receiver-trait>))
(response bool uint))
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `amount` | `uint` | Loan size in microSTX. Must be > 0 and ≤ `max-single-loan`. |
| `receiver` | `<stx-flash-receiver-trait>` | The contract that will receive the STX and execute the strategy. Must be on the approved receiver list. |

**Returns:** `(ok true)` on success.

**Errors**

| Code | Constant | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `u300` | `ERR-NOT-ADMIN` | — |
| `u301` | `ERR-ZERO-AMOUNT` | `amount` is 0 |
| `u302` | `ERR-REPAY-FAILED` | Reserve after callback < reserve before + fee |
| `u303` | `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-RESERVE` | Reserve < `amount` |
| `u304` | `ERR-EXCEEDS-LIMIT` | `amount` > `max-single-loan` |
| `u305` | `ERR-PAUSED` | Protocol is paused |
| `u306` | `ERR-NOT-APPROVED` | Receiver not on allowlist |

**Fee calculation:**  
`fee = max(floor(amount × fee-basis-points / 10000), 1)`  
Default: 5 basis points = 0.05%. On 10 STX, fee = 5,000 microSTX.

**Sequence of events inside `flash-loan`:**
1. Guard checks (paused, amount, limit, approved, reserve)
2. `stx-transfer? amount core receiver-principal` — sends loan
3. `contract-call? receiver execute-stx-flash amount core` — invokes your callback
4. Checks `reserve_after ≥ reserve_before + fee` — verifies repayment
5. Updates `total-loans`, `total-volume`, `total-fees`
6. Returns `(ok true)`

---

### deposit-reserve *(admin only)*

Adds STX to the flash loan reserve from the admin wallet.

## flashstack-sbtc-core

Full address: `SP20XD46NGAX05ZQZDKFYCCX49A3852BQABNP0VG5.flashstack-sbtc-core`  
Explorer: https://explorer.hiro.so/address/SP20XD46NGAX05ZQZDKFYCCX49A3852BQABNP0VG5.flashstack-sbtc-core?chain=mainnet

Canonical sBTC: `SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token`

The sBTC core has the same interface as `flashstack-stx-core` with two differences:
- `flash-loan` accepts a `<sbtc-flash-receiver-trait>` receiver
- The callback is `execute-sbtc-flash` instead of `execute-stx-flash`
- Repayment uses `sbtc-token.transfer` instead of `stx-transfer?`

### flash-loan

```clarity
(define-public (flash-loan
  (amount uint)
  (receiver <sbtc-flash-receiver-trait>))
(response bool uint))
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `amount` | `uint` | Loan size in satoshis. Must be > 0 and ≤ `max-single-loan`. |
| `receiver` | `<sbtc-flash-receiver-trait>` | Must implement `execute-sbtc-flash` and be on the approved list. |

**Errors** (same codes as STX core)

| Code | Constant | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `u300` | `ERR-PAUSED` | Protocol is paused |
| `u301` | `ERR-ZERO-AMOUNT` | Amount is 0 |
| `u302` | `ERR-REPAY-FAILED` | Reserve did not grow by the fee |
| `u303` | `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-RESERVE` | Reserve < amount |
| `u304` | `ERR-EXCEEDS-LIMIT` | Amount > max-single-loan |
| `u306` | `ERR-NOT-APPROVED` | Receiver not on allowlist |
| `u310` | `ERR-NOT-ADMIN` | Admin-only function |
| `u311` | `ERR-TRANSFER-FAILED` | sBTC transfer failed |

### Read-only functions

Same interface as STX core: `get-stats`, `get-reserve-balance`, `get-fee-basis-points`, `get-max-single-loan`, `is-approved-receiver`, `calculate-fee`, `get-admin`.

## Receiver Trait Interfaces

### stx-flash-receiver-trait

Deployed at: `SP3TGRVG7DKGFVRTTVGGS60S59R916FWB4DAB9STZ.stx-flash-receiver-trait`

```clarity
(define-trait stx-flash-receiver-trait
  (
    (execute-stx-flash
      (uint principal)
      (response bool uint))
  )
)
```

Your STX receiver must:
1. Declare `(impl-trait 'SP3TGRVG7DKGFVRTTVGGS60S59R916FWB4DAB9STZ.stx-flash-receiver-trait.stx-flash-receiver-trait)`
2. Define `(define-public (execute-stx-flash (amount uint) (core principal)) ...)`
3. By the time `execute-stx-flash` returns, `stx-get-balance(as-contract tx-sender) ≥ amount + fee` must be true — or the caller `flash-loan` will fail its reserve check and revert the entire transaction

### sbtc-flash-receiver-trait

Deployed at: `SP20XD46NGAX05ZQZDKFYCCX49A3852BQABNP0VG5.sbtc-flash-receiver-trait`

```clarity
(define-trait sbtc-flash-receiver-trait
  (
    (execute-sbtc-flash
      (uint principal)
      (response bool uint))
  )
)
```

Your sBTC receiver must:
1. Declare `(impl-trait 'SP20XD46NGAX05ZQZDKFYCCX49A3852BQABNP0VG5.sbtc-flash-receiver-trait.sbtc-flash-receiver-trait)`
2. Define `(define-public (execute-sbtc-flash (amount uint) (core principal)) ...)`
3. Repay using `(contract-call? 'SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token transfer total-owed tx-sender core none)` wrapped in `as-contract`

## flashstack-pool-oracle

Full address: `SP20XD46NGAX05ZQZDKFYCCX49A3852BQABNP0VG5.flashstack-pool-oracle`

Provides LP share prices for lending protocols that want to accept FlashStack LP positions as collateral.

### get-share-price

Returns the current price of one LP share in microSTX.

```clarity
(define-read-only (get-share-price)
(ok uint))
```

The share price starts at `1,000,000` microSTX (1 STX per share) at first deposit and increases as fees accumulate in the pool.

### get-pool-stats

Returns full pool state: total shares, total STX, share price.

```clarity
(define-read-only (get-pool-stats)
(ok { total-shares: uint, total-stx: uint, share-price: uint }))
```

For full LP collateral integration spec, see [LP_COLLATERAL_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md](LP_COLLATERAL_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md).
